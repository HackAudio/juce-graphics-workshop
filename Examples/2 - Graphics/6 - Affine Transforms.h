    /** You can use the AffineTransform class to apply transformations to the
        Graphics context when you're painting to the screen.

        The Graphics context maintains its own AffineTransform member which can
        be manipulated via Graphics::addTransform(). Each AffineTransform passed
        to this method is applied _on top_ of the Graphics context's previous
        transform. If you add a rotation transform, then a skew transform, the
        final result is that the context will be rotated and skewed.

        When a transform is applied, it applies to the entire clip region that
        the context currently has. So if you were to add a rotation transform,
        its as if you took the entire contents of our window and rotated it
        around the top left point (the origin) of the view.

        Some Graphics methods allow you to pass an AffineTransform object so
        that you don't have to maintain state changes with
        Graphics::addTransform(). This transform will be applied after the text,
        shapes, etc. have been converted to paths and before those paths are
        rasterized.
